<p>Today is 10/8/22. I am curently trying to finish my website which im slowly getting through so thats good. Right now Im working on moving the links for my prjects and journal to the side and into their own boxes. Im not exactly sure what I want the finished product to look like yet but I just want to start forming something and get an idea down.

10/8/22 It's been about a hour and a half and I've added a lot I added a background image using the background image comand then I added pasted the url to some like coten candy colored clouds just as a place holder for a later image. I also tried to repostition the links to my Journal and Projects page but that and I was able to center them however I would have liked to space them out more but I could not figure out how to move the text along the x axis so I'll have to work on that some more and just play around with it. I tried to use inspect eliment on other peoples website to see how they positioned their text but that did not help much.
