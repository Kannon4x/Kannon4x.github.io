10/8/22 It's been about a hour and a half and I've added a lot I added a background image using the background image comand then I added pasted the url to some like coten candy colored clouds just as a place holder for a later image. I also tried to repostition the links to my Journal and Projects page but that and I was able to center them however I would have liked to space them out more but I could not figure out how to move the text along the x axis so I'll have to work on that some more and just play around with it. I tried to use inspect eliment on other peoples website to see how they positioned their text but that did not help much.
